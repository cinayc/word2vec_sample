      "liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\r\n",

      "the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\r\n",

      "animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\r\n",
      "\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\r\n",

      "safe in a thick wood.\r\n",

      "‘The first thing I’ve got to do,’ said Alice to herself, as she wandered\r\n",

      "about in the wood, ‘is to grow to my right size again; and the second\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\r\n",

      "\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. ‘Poor little thing!’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\r\n",

      "\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\r\n",

      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\r\n",
      "\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\r\n",

      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\r\n",

      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\r\n",
      "\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\r\n",

      "I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I\r\n",

      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\r\n",

      "herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\r\n",

      "was on the top of it.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\r\n",

      "mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,\r\n",

      "\n",

      "rather shyly, ‘I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know\r\n",
      "\n",
      "who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\r\n",

      "‘I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,’ Alice replied very politely,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\r\n",
      "\n",
      "different sizes in a day is very confusing.’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It isn’t,’ said the Caterpillar.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why?’ said the Caterpillar.\r\n",

      "good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant\r\n",

      "state of mind, she turned away.\r\n",

      "itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I’m not used to it!’ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And\r\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Of the mushroom,’ said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\r\n",
      "\n",
      "aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\r\n",

      "round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she\r\n",

      "\n",
      "of the edge with each hand.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And now which is which?’ she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\r\n",

      "the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent\r\n",
      "\n",

      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\r\n",

      "\n",
      "changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\r\n",
      "\n",
      "were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\r\n",

      "tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her\r\n",

      "\n",
      "just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops\r\n",
      "\n",
      "of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made\r\n",

      "‘Serpent, I say again!’ repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\r\n",

      "‘As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,’ said the Pigeon;\r\n",

      "contempt. ‘I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE\r\n",
      "\n",
      "with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s no use\r\n",

      "a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\r\n",

      "‘Well, be off, then!’ said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\r\n",

      "\n",
      "she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\r\n",
      "\n",
      "succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\r\n",
      "\n",
      "felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and began talking to herself, as usual. ‘Come, there’s half my plan done\r\n",
      "\n",
      "now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my right\r\n",
      "\n",
      "size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to be done, I wonder?’ As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open\r\n",
      "\n",
      "place, with a little house in it about four feet high. ‘Whoever lives\r\n",
      "\n",
      "there,’ thought Alice, ‘it’ll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "I should frighten them out of their wits!’ So she began nibbling at the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "had brought herself down to nine inches high.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper\r\n",
      "\n",
      "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\r\n",
      "\n",
      "otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened\r\n",
      "\n",
      "by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all\r\n",
      "\n",
      "over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "saying, in a solemn tone, ‘For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to play croquet.’ The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "only changing the order of the words a little, ‘From the Queen. An\r\n",
      "\n",
      "invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s no sort of use in knocking,’ said the Footman, ‘and that for\r\n",
      "\n",
      "two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\r\n",
      "\n",
      "are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\r\n",
      "\n",
      "possibly hear you.’ And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise\r\n",
      "\n",
      "going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Please, then,’ said Alice, ‘how am I to get in?’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There might be some sense in your knocking,’ the Footman went on\r\n",
      "\n",
      "without attending to her, ‘if we had the door between us. For instance,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought decidedly uncivil. ‘But perhaps he can’t help it,’ she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "said to herself; ‘his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?’ she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I shall sit here,’ the Footman remarked, ‘till tomorrow--’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\r\n",
      "\n",
      "skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘--or next day, maybe,’ the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\r\n",
      "\n",
      "as if nothing had happened.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How am I to get in?’ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ARE you to get in at all?’ said the Footman. ‘That’s the first\r\n",
      "\n",
      "question, you know.’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. ‘It’s really\r\n",
      "\n",
      "dreadful,’ she muttered to herself, ‘the way all the creatures argue.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s enough to drive one crazy!’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\r\n",
      "\n",
      "remark, with variations. ‘I shall sit here,’ he said, ‘on and off, for\r\n",
      "\n",
      "days and days.’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But what am I to do?’ said Alice.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Anything you like,’ said the Footman, and began whistling.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,’ said Alice desperately: ‘he’s\r\n",
      "\n",
      "perfectly idiotic!’ And she opened the door and went in.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\r\n",
      "\n",
      "one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!’ Alice said to herself,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "as well as she could for sneezing.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess\r\n",
      "\n",
      "sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\r\n",
      "\n",
      "alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Please would you tell me,’ said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\r\n",
      "\n",
      "not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, ‘why\r\n",
      "\n",
      "your cat grins like that?’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s a Cheshire cat,’ said the Duchess, ‘and that’s why. Pig!’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\r\n",
      "\n",
      "jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that cats COULD grin.’\r\n",

      "‘They all can,’ said the Duchess; ‘and most of ‘em do.’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know of any that do,’ Alice said very politely, feeling quite\r\n",
      "\n",
      "pleased to have got into a conversation.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You don’t know much,’ said the Duchess; ‘and that’s a fact.’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\r\n",
      "\n",
      "be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\r\n",
      "\n",
      "was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\r\n",
      "\n",
      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a\r\n",
      "\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\r\n",
      "\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, PLEASE mind what you’re doing!’ cried Alice, jumping up and down in\r\n",
      "\n",
      "an agony of terror. ‘Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose’; as an unusually\r\n",
      "\n",
      "large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If everybody minded their own business,’ the Duchess said in a hoarse\r\n",
      "\n",
      "growl, ‘the world would go round a deal faster than it does.’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Which would NOT be an advantage,’ said Alice, who felt very glad to get\r\n",

      "an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. ‘Just think of\r\n",

      "what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes\r\n",

      "twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--’\r\n",

      "Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\r\n",

      "be listening, so she went on again: ‘Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is\r\n",

      "\n",
      "they pinched it on both sides at once.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. ‘I wasn’t asleep,’ he said in a\r\n",

      "hoarse, feeble voice: ‘I heard every word you fellows were saying.’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tell us a story!’ said the March Hare.\r\n",

      "‘Yes, please do!’ pleaded Alice.\r\n",

      "\n",

      "in a great hurry; ‘and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "they lived at the bottom of a well--’\r\n",

      "\n",
      "‘So they were,’ said the Dormouse; ‘VERY ill.’\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: ‘But\r\n",
      "\n",
      "why did they live at the bottom of a well?’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Take some more tea,’ the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\r\n",

      "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself\r\n",
      "\n",
      "to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "repeated her question. ‘Why did they live at the bottom of a well?’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\r\n",
      "\n",
      "said, ‘It was a treacle-well.’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s no such thing!’ Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\r\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘One, indeed!’ said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\r\n",

      "go on. ‘And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What did they draw?’ said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Treacle,’ said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I want a clean cup,’ interrupted the Hatter: ‘let’s all move one place\r\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\r\n",
      "\n",
      "moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took\r\n",
      "\n",
      "the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\r\n",
      "\n",
      "advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\r\n",
      "\n",
      "before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\r\n",
      "\n",
      "cautiously: ‘But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treacle\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You can draw water out of a water-well,’ said the Hatter; ‘so I should\r\n",

      "think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But they were IN the well,’ Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to\r\n",
      "\n",
      "notice this last remark.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course they were’, said the Dormouse; ‘--well in.’\r\n",

      "some time without interrupting it.\r\n",

      "\n",
      "its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; ‘and they drew all manner of\r\n",

      "things--everything that begins with an M--’\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why with an M?’ said Alice.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why not?’ said the March Hare.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was silent.\r\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with\r\n",
      "\n",
      "a little shriek, and went on: ‘--that begins with an M, such as\r\n",
      "\n",
      "mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say\r\n",
      "\n",

      "great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\r\n",
      "\n",
      "neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\r\n",

      "\n",
      "Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\r\n",

      "the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\r\n",
      "\n",
      "jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented\r\n",
